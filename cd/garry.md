## Demo 9th August

* he's not a potential customer: doesn't write a lot of docs
* groks the problem / opportunity
* not entirely convinced by the direction:
  * need to ungeek it a bit: make a UI, not <!-- syntax -->
  * suggests when writing just want to write
  * when collating, want a 30,000 foot view designed to collate / assemble from parts
* suggested features:
  * placeholder / variable substitution (e.g.: on publish)
  * document templates, e.g.: example business plan, proposal, case study etc.
